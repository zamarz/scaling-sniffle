# Wordpress Tutorial Site

https://github.com/zamarz/scaling-sniffle/blob/main/Site-screenshot.png

This is a project where I learnt how to use Wordpress with PHP. It is a fake site for a university that helped me develop web and PHP skills.

If you would like to develop something similar the course is here: https://www.udemy.com/course/become-a-wordpress-developer-php-javascript/

# How to use

Simply git clone the files onto your system in order to see them. To get the site up and running, you'll need Local and have to start your own project on your local server.
